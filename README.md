# GreenWood ðŸŒ¿

**GreenWood** is a smart waste management platform developed as part of the **Green Hackathon** organized by **Mahi Club, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Chennai Campus**. The project aims to address improper waste disposal and segregation on campuses. Built using **Next.js** and powered by **Google Gemini AI**, the platform incorporates machine learning to classify waste and incentivizes recycling behavior. 

Currently, GreenWood is a software-based solution. In the future, we plan to extend the system by integrating **CCTV monitoring** and **Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)** for broader use in villages, municipalities, and societies.

## Problem Statement

Inappropriate waste segregation and disposal methods are causing severe environmental deterioration on campuses. Overflowing landfills and incorrect disposal of recyclable and hazardous materials further worsen the issue. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of incentives and effective monitoring systems.

---

## Solution

GreenWood provides an **integrated Smart Waste Management System** designed to combat these issues. The system uses:
- **Machine Learning-based Waste Classification** to automate and improve waste sorting.
- **Incentive Systems** to encourage responsible waste disposal, with future goals including **Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)** and **CCTV Monitoring** for enhanced tracking and feedback.

Through these features, we aim to encourage correct waste disposal, reduce landfill overuse, and foster a sustainable, environmentally friendly campus.

## Key Features

1. **Machine Learning Waste Classification**:  
   - Users manually scan and classify waste to train the machine learning model.
   - Once trained, the model automates waste classification.

2. **Incentives and Rewards**:  
   - Rewards for proper waste disposal and potential penalties for repeated incorrect disposal (e.g., fines or environmental service tasks).
   
3. **Leaderboard**:  
   - Users can track their contributions via a leaderboard, encouraging friendly competition and increasing recycling efforts.

---

## Method of Approach

### Phase I: Waste Classification & Machine Learning Training
- Users manually scan and classify waste, allowing the ML model to learn and improve.
- An incentive system rewards top recyclers via a leaderboard.

### Phase II: Future Integrations
- **CCTV Monitoring**:  
   After completing the software project, we plan to integrate **CCTV cameras** to monitor waste disposal in real-time.
  
- **Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)**:  
   In future implementations, RVMs will be placed at strategic locations on campus to collect recyclables (e.g., plastic bottles, cans, e-waste) and offer incentives such as cash rewards or donations to environmental causes.

## Future Goals

- **CCTV and Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) Integration**:  
   We plan to extend the system by integrating CCTV monitoring for real-time feedback on waste disposal and Reverse Vending Machines to incentivize recycling.

- **Mobile Application**:  
   Develop a mobile app for a more accessible waste management system beyond the campus.

- **Expanded Use Cases**:  
   Adapt the system for use in municipalities, villages, and broader communities to foster sustainable waste management on a larger scale.

- **Enhanced ML Model**:  
   Continuously improve the AI model for waste classification to automate segregation and reduce human intervention.
