# GreenWood ðŸŒ¿

**GreenWood** is a smart waste management platform developed to address improper waste disposal and segregation on campuses. Built using **Next.js** and powered by **Google Gemini AI**, the platform incorporates machine learning to classify waste, incentivizes recycling through reverse vending machines, and monitors disposal behavior via CCTV cameras.

Though currently a web application, we plan to extend GreenWood to mobile platforms for broader use in villages, municipalities, and societies.

## Problem Statement

Inappropriate waste segregation and disposal methods are causing severe environmental deterioration on campuses. Overflowing landfills and the incorrect disposal of recyclable and hazardous materials further worsen the issue. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of incentives and effective monitoring systems.

---

## Solution

GreenWood provides an **integrated Smart Waste Management System** designed to combat these issues. The system uses:
- **Reverse Vending Machines** to reward users for recycling.
- **Machine Learning-based Waste Classification** to automate and improve waste sorting.
- **CCTV Monitoring** to track and provide feedback on waste disposal in real-time.

Through these features, we aim to encourage correct waste disposal, reduce landfill overuse, and foster a sustainable, environmentally friendly campus.

## Key Features

1. **Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)**:  
   - Placed at strategic campus locations to collect recyclables like plastic bottles, cans, and e-waste.
   - Users receive cash rewards, donations to environmental projects, or other incentives for proper disposal.

2. **Machine Learning Waste Classification**:  
   - Users manually scan and classify waste to train the machine learning model.
   - Once trained, the model automates waste classification, with real-time monitoring via CCTV.

3. **Incentives and Penalties**:  
   - Rewards for proper waste disposal and penalties for repeated incorrect disposal (e.g., fines or mandatory participation in environmental activities).

4. **CCTV Monitoring**:  
   - CCTV cameras integrated with the ML model monitor waste disposal across the campus, providing immediate feedback and potential penalties.

---

## Method of Approach

### Phase I: Waste Classification & Machine Learning Training
- Users manually scan and classify waste, allowing the ML model to learn and improve.
- Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) incentivize correct recycling by offering cash rewards or donations.
- An incentive system rewards top recyclers via a leaderboard. Incorrect waste disposal triggers sarcastic feedback.

### Phase II: CCTV and Machine Learning Integration
- CCTV cameras monitor waste disposal in real-time.
- Advanced ML models detect improper disposal, providing immediate feedback or penalties (e.g., fines).

## How to Use

1. **Waste Classification**:  
   Users scan and classify waste manually, allowing the AI model to learn and improve over time.

2. **Reverse Vending Machine**:  
   Users deposit recyclables (e.g., plastic, cans) into RVMs and receive incentives (e.g., cash or donations).

3. **Real-time Monitoring**:  
   The ML model, integrated with CCTV cameras, provides real-time feedback on disposal practices.

4. **Leaderboard and Rewards**:  
   Users can track their contributions via a leaderboard and receive rewards for proper waste disposal.

## Future Goals

- **Mobile Application**:  
   Develop a mobile app for a more accessible waste management system beyond the campus.
  
- **Expanded Use Cases**:  
   Adapt the system for use in municipalities, villages, and broader communities to foster sustainable waste management on a larger scale.
  
- **Enhanced ML Model**:  
   Continuously improve the AI model for waste classification to automate segregation and reduce human intervention.
